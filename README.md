# Nutritionist Chatbot
 An AIML-based nutritionist chatbot created using Python and Discord API.
 
 Use Python 3.6.x for better support. Some dependencies stopped working from 3.8 or higher.
 
 
 1. Sign up for a [Discord](https://discord.com/) Account. Create an account on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs).
 2. Create a bot on the portal. Pass the correct permissions. Deploy the bot on your server. 
 3. Copy the bot's token. Paste it a new file titled token.txt .
 4. Preferably use a virtual environment. Install all the requirements from the requirements file.
 5. Paste the server's name, channel's name and the invite link into the main.py file.
 6. Run the main.py file. Install the additional requirements if necessary.
 7. Run the [main.py](/main.py) file. Deploy the bot on any text channel. Use Heroku for 24x7 service.

 The AIML files - [Cathy](https://github.com/DevDungeon/Cathy/tree/master/cathy/aiml/alice) and [Standard](https://github.com/russellhaering/ansr8r/tree/master/standard). 
 You can also add [this free PandoraBots AIML file](https://github.com/pandorabots/Free-AIML).
 If you decide to add, alter or delete any AIML file(s), you'd have to delete the bot_brain.brn file before every run for the changes in your AIML file to be reflected in your output.
